1.Precision?
Banks aim for precision > 0.97 for sensitive flows (online purchases, cross-border transactions) while maintaining recall at an acceptable level.

2.Feature Engineering
2.1 Transaction-Level Features
Amount, merchant category, terminal type
Time of day, day of week
Device fingerprint, browser metadata
Geolocation, IP, risky markets
Sequential frequency (burst transactions)

2.2 Customer Behavioral Features
Typical spending pattern
Daily/monthly averages
Transaction velocity
Time between consecutive transactions
Preferred merchants/categories

2.3 Network/Graph Features
Shared devices, IP addresses
Merchant–user bipartite graph
Fraud rings & collusion patterns


2.4 ML models:
Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost / LightGBM)
Best for real-time scoring
Handles non-linear interactions
Easily explainable → important for RBI/PCI compliance
Typically give precision > 0.95 with tuned thresholds

Use precision-recall curve instead of ROC.
