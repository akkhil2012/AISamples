Please create me a json file that I can import in n8n workflow so I can accomplish the below:
I want the nodes to use the prompts to define the configurations for all nodes using openAI prompts

The n8n prompts should have the below 5 nodes:
DB2 node named as Db2Node, DataMoverNode , cockroachDB node, AWS s3 bucket Node , Apache spark Node , ResultantNode a simple node that generates .pdf file

The data should reside table name say ACCOUNT_DB2 with same DDL with additional few columns in CockRoachDB
THE table column should resemble how in general practice a current account would have; say in JP Morgan and chase bank
Need to insert thousands of data in the tables defined for DB2 say ACCOUNT_DB2
Need to insert thousands of data in the tables defined for CockRoachDB say ACCOUNT_CKDB

Step1: Db2Node need to pull data from db2 in large batch size and store in a file in local disk, say Db2_file
  The data in table should be in thousands
Step2: DataMoverNode n8n node Need to push the data from the file we have created in step1 to AWS s3 bucket.
Step3: I need to pull data from cockroachDB in large batch size and store in a file in local disk, say CKDB_file
Step4: Use the Apache spark job to compare the data across the two files we created above in Step1 and Step2.
      The comparison should be done both in terms of data quality and also based on attribute level mismatches
Step5:Apache Spark should generate the details comparison report showing the data mismatch between table
   To ResultantNode which should generate the result in .pdf file format
Step6: LLM should recommend and create the scripts to fix the data quality issue

1. Context-Engineering

2. LLM:
     Model Classification
   Specialized Model Categories
   Audio/Speech Recognition: Whisper-type models for multilingual speech recognition
   Image Generation: DALL-E (available through Azure OpenAI) and Midjourney
   Text Generation: GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 (with varying costs, GPT-4 being most expensive)
   Multi-modal: GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and GPT-4o for combining text and visual understanding
   Open Source vs. Proprietary Models
   Model Architecture: 
      Decoder Only
      Encoder Only
      Encoder-Decoder
   Approach to improve the LLM Model Performance
     1. Prompt Engineering with Context
     2. RAG
